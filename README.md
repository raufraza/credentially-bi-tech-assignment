A reference is requested for a specific candidate to verify their reliability with third parties. Once a reference is requested, it goes through the stages of **"submitted"** and then **"reviewed."** It is important to receive and review the reference as soon as possible to speed up the hiring process.  

In the repository, you will find a pre-prepared semantic model along with sources describing references, the job positions for which they were requested, and some other data related to job positions.  

### Task  

1. **Fork the provided repository to your own account.** Please complete the assignment within this forked repository.
2. **Load and analyze the data** that will be used to build this report. What issues do you see with the data, and how can they be addressed?  
3. **Build a simple dashboard** based on the prepared semantic model and some calculations that may be useful to you. Highlight the key metrics that you would emphasize for the client as the most significant in the context of references. Feel free to modify the semantic model/calculations for your purposes.  
4. **When you are finished, please send us the link to your forked repository** with the changes you made, including your dashboard. If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to ask.
